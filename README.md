# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
* Louise I was able to analyze your project for your new theatrical play you want to kickstart. The good news is that you are able to jumpstart your project starting May. There is a lot of support by backers for your types of plays that you like. I will be sharing with you my photographic analysis to show you that you are in the correct track to doing a successful play in the United States. 
* I know you also have interest in pursuing another project similarly as some musicals from Great Britain. Make sure to look at the Box Plot image as it gives more insight on what is the outliers in the GB musicals and how much they receive  by backers and how much people are using to start their musicals.
