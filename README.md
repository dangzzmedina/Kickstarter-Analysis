# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
We were assigned to analyze outcomes based on dates & analyze outcomes based on goals. The assignment required filtering, wirting formulas, implementing Pivot Tables & Charts to get to present the story behind the data.

### Purpose
The purpose of this module is to get to know Excel in a Data Entry perspective to be able to tell a story behind the information provided. Lastly, being able to use Excel tools to get to the end of the story.

## Analysis and Challenges

Louise, has been intrigued in how different programs had been doing based on fundraising goals. She wants to know their outcomes based on the date the programs started and on their fundraising goals. This assignment had a couple of challenges including but not limited to:
* Creating Formulas with CountIf, SUM & Average
* Designing Pivot Charts to narrow down data to answer Louise's questions
* Creating Visualizations through Pivot Charts to make a more user-friendly picture of the analyzed data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In the analysis of the outcomes based on launch date, I was able to learn that theater outcomes were more successful when they started the program around May and June using datasets between the years of 2012 and 2017.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

In the analysis of the outcomes based on goals, I was able to learn that the subcategory of plays were more sucessful when the plays had a fundraising goal were less than $1000 but also quite successful at fundraising goals around $3500 to $4500.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
My challenges were the formulas I needed to implement to count for the numbers of plays successful as the formula was nested with different variables to look for. Also, I encountered some difficulties while arranging rows in my Pivot Table to sort from Lowest to Highest Goal amounts.

## Results

**What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

The two conclusions I can draw out for Louise are the following:
*Start the project around summer (May or June). fundraising backers are more willing to monetarily assist in these period of time. 
*Theater projects is less than 100% of successful theater projects which means if Louise really likes theater projects, to stick with them as backers and the subcategory are more successful around the time she likes to start projects (like the Fever workshop production).

**What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

Louise's play Fever came close to getting to her fundraising goal as her fundraising goal was a little bit high compared to other projects from around the world. If she wishes to have a successful play, she will need to lower her fundraising goal. When the fundraising goals are less than $1000, there is a higher chance of having a successful play.

**What are some limitations of this dataset?**
Some of the limitations of this dataset that goals are not distilled into countries. If we used the dataset into a microlevel, we might be able to show a more precise analysis of what should be recommend to Louise. It is great to see it in a macrolevel and look at different countries, but looking also into the microlevel side can give us more insight. Lastly, if we had a dataset that shows the time when backers assist, she might have a more accurate timeframe on when to look for backers.

**What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

Some other possible tables and/or graphs we could create to give a more enriched analysis would be looking the count of backers by plays in different counties. That way we can see if the plays in her country are more susceptible in meeting the funding goals for her future plays.
